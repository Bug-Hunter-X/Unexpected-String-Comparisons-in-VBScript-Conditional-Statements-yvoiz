This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VBScript: implicit type coercion in conditional statements.  The `f` function is intended to compare two values and display a message based on their relationship.  However, when strings are passed as arguments, VBScript's implicit type conversion can lead to unexpected results, causing incorrect output. The solution clarifies the comparison process by explicitly converting strings to numbers before making the comparison, preventing this bug. This scenario highlights the importance of explicit type handling in VBScript to avoid runtime errors and ensure the correctness of conditional logic.
